### What is github?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

- **Showcase or share** your work.
- **Track and manage** changes to your code over time.
- Let others **review** your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
- **Collaborate** on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.

Collaborative working, one of GitHubâ€™s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.



### Link your local git repository to remote repository

```bash
git remote add [name] [remote address]

#check remote
git remote -v

#push your commits to remote
git push [remote name] [remote branch]
```
